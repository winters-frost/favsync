# favsync

> A command-line tool for managing downloading media from user-saved posts.

## Getting Started

`favsync` is a python project which utilizes a mixture of official site APIs as
well as some basic web-scraping. APIs are preferred as they are generally more
reliable, however they are not always available or cannot provide specific or
niche features. For the latter we will rely upon web-scraping.

### Usage

*TODO add description of available options*

``` bash
python favsync
```
